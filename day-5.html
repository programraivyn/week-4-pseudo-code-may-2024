<h3>Problem:</h3>
Kataleia has $74, and she wants to purchase a oreo cheesecake for herself and her three friends. The price of an oreo cheesecake 
is $18.50. Will she have enough to buy a cheesecake for her three friends and herself?

<em>Declarations</em>:

let k = the amount of money Kata has
let c = the cost of one oreo cheesecake 

let k = 74
let c = 18.50

<h3>Solution:</h3> If k >= c * 4:<br>
<em>Result</em>:<br>
    Then: she can purchase the oreo cheesecakes for herself and her friends.
    Else: she would not have enough to buy a cheesecake for each of her three friends and herself. <br>
<h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
Let k be 74<br>
<em>Result</em>:
<script>
    function f(c) {
        return c * 4
    }

    let k;
</script>
<p>f(c)= 4 * 18.50</p>
   f(c)= <script>
        k = f(18.50);
        document.write(k);
    </script>

<h3>Discussion:</h3>
If Kataleia has $74 and the price of one cheesecake is $18.50 then she can purchase an oreo cheesecake for herself 
as well as her three friends. This is because she has just enough money to cover the cost of the $18.50 oreo cheesecake 
four times. Therefore, if the cheesecake was more than $18.50 each, she would not be able to afford buying one for 
herself and all three of her friends.
